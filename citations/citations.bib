We examined measurement invariance across 92 groups (country by cohort by gender), finding that a five-item scale was statistically well-grounded for unbiased group comparisons despite the presence of significant noninvariance in some groups. Using the resulting group mean scores, we compared European youth’s attitudes finding that female students had more positive attitudes than did male students across countries and cohorts. An analysis of countries participating in both studies revealed that students in most countries demonstrated more positive attitudes in 2009 than in 1999. The alignment methodology makes it feasible to comprehensively assess measurement invariance in large data sets and to compute aligned factor scores for the full sample that can update existing databases for more efficient further secondary analysis and with metainformation concerning measurement invariance.},

	abstract = {The comparison of group means in latent variable models plays a vital role in empirical research in the social sciences. The present article discusses an extension of invariance alignment and Haberman linking by choosing the robust power loss function ρ(x)={\textbar}x{\textbar}p(p{\textgreater}0). This power loss function with power values p smaller than one is particularly suited for item responses that are generated under partial invariance. For a general class of linking functions, asymptotic normality of estimates is shown. Moreover, the theory of M-estimation is applied for obtaining linking errors (i.e., inference with respect to a population of items) for this class of linking functions. In a simulation study, it is shown that invariance alignment and Haberman linking have comparable performance, and in some conditions, the newly proposed robust Haberman linking outperforms invariance alignment. In three examples, the influence of the choice of a particular linking function on the estimation of group means is demonstrated. It is concluded that the choice of the loss function in linking is related to structural assumptions about the pattern of noninvariance in item parameters.},

However, this study demonstrated that MIMIC was insensitive to the presence of factor loading noninvariance, which implies that factor loading invariance should be tested through other measurement invariance testing techniques. MIMIC modeling is also used for measurement invariance testing by allowing a direct path from a grouping covariate to each observed variable. This simulation study with both continuous and categorical variables investigated the performance of MIMIC in detecting noninvariant variables under various study conditions and showed that the likelihood ratio test of MIMIC with Oort adjustment not only controlled Type I error rates below the nominal level but also maintained high power across study conditions.},
