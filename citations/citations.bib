However, this study demonstrated that MIMIC was insensitive to the presence of factor loading noninvariance, which implies that factor loading invariance should be tested through other measurement invariance testing techniques. MIMIC modeling is also used for measurement invariance testing by allowing a direct path from a grouping covariate to each observed variable. This simulation study with both continuous and categorical variables investigated the performance of MIMIC in detecting noninvariant variables under various study conditions and showed that the likelihood ratio test of MIMIC with Oort adjustment not only controlled Type I error rates below the nominal level but also maintained high power across study conditions.},

	abstract = {The comparison of group means in latent variable models plays a vital role in empirical research in the social sciences. The present article discusses an extension of invariance alignment and Haberman linking by choosing the robust power loss function ρ(x)={\textbar}x{\textbar}p(p{\textgreater}0). This power loss function with power values p smaller than one is particularly suited for item responses that are generated under partial invariance. For a general class of linking functions, asymptotic normality of estimates is shown. Moreover, the theory of M-estimation is applied for obtaining linking errors (i.e., inference with respect to a population of items) for this class of linking functions. In a simulation study, it is shown that invariance alignment and Haberman linking have comparable performance, and in some conditions, the newly proposed robust Haberman linking outperforms invariance alignment. In three examples, the influence of the choice of a particular linking function on the estimation of group means is demonstrated. It is concluded that the choice of the loss function in linking is related to structural assumptions about the pattern of noninvariance in item parameters.},

We examined measurement invariance across 92 groups (country by cohort by gender), finding that a five-item scale was statistically well-grounded for unbiased group comparisons despite the presence of significant noninvariance in some groups. Using the resulting group mean scores, we compared European youth’s attitudes finding that female students had more positive attitudes than did male students across countries and cohorts. An analysis of countries participating in both studies revealed that students in most countries demonstrated more positive attitudes in 2009 than in 1999. The alignment methodology makes it feasible to comprehensively assess measurement invariance in large data sets and to compute aligned factor scores for the full sample that can update existing databases for more efficient further secondary analysis and with metainformation concerning measurement invariance.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the approximate approach to assess measurement invariance with 
(longitudinal) confirmatory factor analysis. Approximate measurement invariance uses 
zero-mean, small-variance Bayesian priors to allow minor differences in estimated 
parameters across time, while still maintaining comparability of the underlying constructs. 
The procedure is illustrated for the first time with panel data on young peoples’ preferences 
to maximize pleasure and enjoy life. Results indicate whereas the traditional approach of 
exact measurement invariance failed to establish scalar invariance across time and precluded 
comparisons of latent means, it was possible to establish approximate scalar invariance. 
Based on a monitoring procedure for model fit and convergence, a rather small prior variance 
was deemed sufficient to account for minor deviations of cross-time intercept differences 
from zero.},

	abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent "statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a \&\#x3c7;2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},
